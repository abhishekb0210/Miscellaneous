This was an attempt to implement/evaluate various text/sentence embeddings like TFIDF, Word2Vec, Doc2vec, Universal Sentence Encoder, etc. 
The problem was to form the well differentiated cluster across the dataset using various unsupervised clustering techniques.
Final selected process was as follows:<br>
a) Text cleaning <br>
b) Sentence embeddings using Universal Sentence Encoder by Google<br>
c) PCA and tSNE for dimensionality reductions <br>
d) Clustering using Kmeans <br>
